Dataset with real pictures: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Ryan-sjtu/ffhq512-caption
It has 70,000 pictures. I've randomly chosen 500 and "added smile" using file Adding_smile
The link to 500 real and fake pictures: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ql_F3fVPOCjBH2ogdEJPn_tP95N7gDAm?usp=share_link
The other dataset (GAN generated): https://medium.com/generated-photos/press-aaeb26e632d1

The gradient is generated in NoiseScaleError&Gradient. 
The KL comparison in grad_diff_KL


Modifications on "gradients" are also considered ...
